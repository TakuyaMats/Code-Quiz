## 1. Process

I want to point out first and foremost, this has been the most difficult homework I've had to do so far. I felt as if I was not prepared for this level of javascript and found myself searching the web for solutions most of the time. This has been a big realizing to me that I will need to get more practice in!
```
Things I could not add because of time constraint:
- Final score does not show up at the ending screen.
- Submission of initials can not be submitted.
- media query has not been added.
- When time runs out it does not start the quiz over.
